        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired</li>
            <li>Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth and thick. Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
        </ol>
