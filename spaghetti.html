        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a dish intended for your left-over spaghetti. In my house there never seems to be enough left over to make this, so seeing as we love this dish a lot I make it with fresh spaghetti. Night #1 we are all dancing in our seat with pleasure as we eat dinner and lunch on day #2 is a treat beyond words.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package thin spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 cups prepared spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup small curd cottage cheese</li>
            <li>Â½ cup fat-free sour cream</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook until pasta is tender but still slightly firm, about 10 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Transfer spaghetti to a large bowl and toss with spaghetti sauce until well combined.</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese and sour cream in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread half the spaghetti with sauce into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Place the remaining spaghetti and sauce in an even layer over the cottage cheese mixture; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the cheese is browned, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
